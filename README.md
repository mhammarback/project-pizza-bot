# Pizza Bot

This project was made during the Technigo Bootcamp.
The purpose was to practice Javascript functions while using pair-programming. 

## The project

- We used pair-programming and worked remote.
- We started with making all the functions work 
- Added some basic design 
- We are using prompt to get the data from the costumer and then we display
  the final order on the main page with details such as how many pizzas you
  have orderd, which sort and how long it will take. 
- The next step for this project would be to create a form instead of using prompt.
